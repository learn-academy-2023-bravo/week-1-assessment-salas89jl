# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: While git is the a form of comceptualized code sharing type platform, Github is a site that is based on the git platform. 

Researched answer: According to open ai.:
Git is a system that uses a distrubuting version control, which allows developvers to record the changes to ther code and collaborate with other on software projects. In 2005 Linus Torvalds created the git system, and git was "designed to be fast, scalable, and flexible." Git gave developers the ability to create branches, merge changes in codes, and "revert to previous versions of thier code." 

While Github, in comparison to git, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories, and "was fouded in 2008 and is now owned by Microsof. Github provides a platform  for dvelopers to stor, share, and collaborate on thier code. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:
===

Researched answer: (from: OpenAI) (Summerized by Jose)
There are many JS operators that will return a Boolean value. These types of operators are used often in conditional statements to control the program flow of execution. The following are examples of operators that return a Boolean value:

a. Comparison operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=
b. Logical operators: &&, ||, !
c. Equality operators: Object.is(), Object.isnt()

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: The best way I can describe an index is by imagining a cubby hole set that only has one row. This one row cuby hole has collapsable inner walls that be re arranged to custom fit each cubby. however, this is a magical cubby hole because we can add or take out as many indiviual cubies as we want to. But is this case, keeping the cubby hole to 5 cubbies is good for now. And we decided to label each cubie, and wanted to be labeled by numbers. we start at the first one on the left and we will label it "0", the next cubie "1", and so on until we reach the 5 cubie labeled "4". 

Using the cubby holes anology, I consider the index of an array as being the same as each cubby hole. arrayOne.index "1" = Second slot to left of an actual cubby hole.

As for value of an array, it is the product/element that is inserted, altered, or removed in each cuby hole.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Keeping in my the cubby hole anology from question 3. I like to think about strings differently. Strings are more like text banners made up from characters hoisted on clothes lines. They can be small or large banners, size depending of the input of characters.

While both may contian objects(such as a collection of characters)/elements one us designed to be able to contain more than just a list of charaters. 

Researched answer: (from: OpenAI) 

"While arrays and strings share some similarities in terms of how they are accessed and how their length is determined, they differ in terms of thier mutability, they types of values they can store, and the methods and features available for manipulating and working with them."

Similarities:
- Both are type of data structures in JS.
- Both store data, with strings storing sequences of characters and arrays storing collection of values.
- Both can be accessed using bracket notation, where index represents the [p]osition of the value in the data structure.
- Both have a length property that indicates the number of elelemtns in the data structure. 

Differences:
- Strings are immutable, meaing that once created they cannot be changed. You can create a new string by concatenating or clicing parts of the original string, but the original string remains the same. Arrays, however, are mutable. You can change an array's elements by adding, removing, or modifying values in the array. 
- Arrays have a variety of built-in methods for manipulating and iterating while string have fewer. 
- Strings have some features that are not presented in arrays, such as the ability to use string interpolation with template literal. And, the ability use regular expressions to search and manipulate the string.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper Pair programming techniques include establising responsibilities such as one person assumes the role of Driver and the other(s) role of Navigator(s). The driver physically manipulates the code in the IDE while engaging with the Navigator(s) in order to accomplish tasks. While the Navigators guides, backup review for proper syntax entries, and researches additional options for issues that may arrise while programming.  Another technieque in pair programming is developing a plan to follow for excuting a task assigned to the pair.
